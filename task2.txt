Task 2:
The test executes the function complex_function() which also relies on
random_function which is non-deterministic (results may differ per execution)

This makes it unreliable because the function random_function may produce
different results every time it runs and the value may or may not pass the if statement

To test this, we need to make the function deterministic (having a permanent result
for every execution). Source codes should produce a solid result during execution
for them to be valid to test.

It is also would be better to transform the expected output of the test to fit a template
rather than a rigid answer. This makes it more reliable for the system to understand
and define the execution of codes.

We could also test on the property of the output itself rather than the output for example
the data type (i.e float/double). However, it is not encouraged because testing should be
done on behaviours not implementation of codes
